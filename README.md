# LifeStyle-Store

<br>

Lifestyle is India’s leading fashion destination for the latest trends. The Landmark Group, Lifestyle brings multiple categories including men’s, women and kids’ apparel, footwear, handbags, fashion accessories and beauty under the convenience of a single roof, now let’s start with the project explanation.

Getting Started…
We are a group of 4 people working on the project to clone the LifeStyle website. We Collaborate and first take a deep look at the website tried to mark important features of the website to clone it in our project and later than we discussed and divided work and started working on it.
While surfing the website we find that the website is very user friendly and very easy to navigate from one type of product to another. We plan to make the navbar very similar to the original website because we like that part a lot. Later there are many more features on the website like add to cart option, Cart page, single product detailed page, sign Up and Sign In, Payment page, On hover feature and many more, we tried to add many of them in our clone website. For cloning the website we used Tech-Stacks Html, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap.

This is the landing page of clone LifeStore we tried to make an exact replica of the main landing page with almost every functionality similar to the original web page. Here when the user hovers on the navbar he or she will get the mega menu drop down below the navbar with multiple options in it and if again hover on any option from the first dropdown user will get another dropdown of a submenu of that particular category or option and finally clicking on any of the options he/she will redirect that product landing page or product page depends on the user click.

When any user clicks on the Sign-in and Sign-up button a pop-up will come on the screen where the user needs to enter the phone number and click on the continue button similarly, the user has to enter the OTP, Email, User Name and click on continue later user can continue with the shopping
